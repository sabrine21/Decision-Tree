# Decision-Tree

A decision tree is a predictive model that uses a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences. 
It's a hierarchical model that splits the data into smaller subsets based on certain criteria.

The decision tree is constructed from a set of training data, and it is used to classify new, unseen instances. 
Each internal node of the decision tree represents a test on a specific attribute, and each branch represents the outcome of that test. 
The leaf nodes represent the final decision or outcome.


# How to Build a Decision Tree
* Choose the attribute to split the data.
* Calculate the entropy of the split.
* Calculate the information gain of the split.
* Choose the attribute with the highest information gain.
* Create a new branch for each possible value of the chosen attribute.
* Repeat steps 1-5 for each branch until all data is classified.

# Conclusion
Decision trees are a popular machine learning algorithm because they are easy to understand and interpret. 
They can be used for both classification and regression tasks, and they can handle both categorical and numerical data. 
However, decision trees can easily overfit the data if the tree is too deep or if there are too many features. 
They may not be suitable for data sets with many features or attributes.
